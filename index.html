I have extended experience in TEEs (e.g. Intel SGX, Arm TrustZone) and the runtime environments of high-level programming languages such as JavaScript and Lua.</div>

                            <h6>LuaGardia is a system that simplifies the development of confidential computing. LuaGardia addresses
                                several TEE challenges such as the lack of high-level TEE abstractions, technical issues regarding runtime
                                extensibility, management of cryptographic operations, and restricted interfaces: even porting existing
                                applications requires manual partitioning, re-compilation, and linking steps.</h6></li>
                        <li> Distributed Code Execution on Javascript atop of TEEs (Ongoing Project)
                            <h6> Dynamic code distribution on Intel SGX nodes that are deployed on the cloud. QuickJS is the interpreter
                                which is ported inside the SGX enclaves, used as a drop-in Javascript replacement. Several improvements
                                are implemented on the enclaves as well as to the QuickJS interpreter regarding faster initialization and
                                instantiation, I/O handling and system-call validation and integrity.

                                Implementation and integration of Lua interpreter on Trusty TEE, offloading and executing the critical
                                parts of the applications inside the TEE. A wide set of applications are tested from micro-benchmarks,
                                to cryptographic algorithms but also to larger applications such as NoSQL databases, HTTP servers
                                and pattern matchers.
