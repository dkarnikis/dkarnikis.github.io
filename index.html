            <div id="about-me-text">I am a software engineer/consultant interested in high-impact research projects related to systems security and low-level internals of programming language runtimes. I have extended experience in TEEs (e.g. Intel SGX, Arm TrustZone) and the runtime environments of high-level programming languages such as JavaScript and Lua.</div>

                     <h6>LuaGardia is a system that simplifies the development of confidential computing. LuaGardia addresses
                        several TEE challenges such as the lack of high-level TEE abstractions, technical issues regarding runtime
                        extensibility, management of cryptographic operations, and restricted interfaces: even porting existing
                        applications requires manual partitioning, re-compilation, and linking steps.

                        which is ported inside the SGX enclaves, used as a drop-in Javascript replacement. Several improvements
                        are implemented on the enclaves as well as to the QuickJS interpreter regarding faster initialization and
                        instantiation, I/O handling and system-call validation and integrity.

                        to cryptographic algorithms but also to larger applications such as NoSQL databases, HTTP servers
                        and pattern matchers.
